## Fungible token

It doesn't hold a unique value. For instance, when you and your friend get 1 Ethereum (ETH) which is an ERC20 token each. Both of you have the same value. It's uniform. Think of it like money but in token.
Example of fungible tokens:

- Bitcoin
- Ethereum
- Cardano

## Non-fungible token

Token that is linked to a digital asset. It holds a unique value. For instance, when you get that art as NFT. You owned it. Your ownership is on the blockchain. Since the art data and your address inside blockchain are immutable, people can't manipulate it to have their own name unless they buy it from the owner of the NFT via NFT marketplace.

Example of non-fungible tokens:
